AR based mobile application

This project is a mobile application that uses Augmented Reality (AR) to enhance the real-world environment by overlaying digital content. Developed using Unity and the Vuforia SDK, the app detects real-world images or objects through the mobile device's camera and displays interactive 3D models, animations, or information in real time. It provides an immersive and engaging user experience, demonstrating the potential of AR in areas like education, marketing, and entertainment.
